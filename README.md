üì¶ Supply Chain Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing supply chain operations to identify bottlenecks, optimize inventory levels, forecast demand, and minimize operational costs. The final outcome is an interactive dashboard to support decision-making for business operations.

üìÅ Project Overview
Project Title: Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), MySQL, Power BI, Excel

Duration: 4 Weeks

Role: Business Operations Analyst (Intern)

Organization: ApanaTime Technology Pvt. Ltd.

Dataset: supply_chain_extended_data.csv

üßæ Objective
To perform data-driven analysis of supply chain processes with the aim to:

Improve demand forecasting accuracy

Minimize delivery delays and backorders

Optimize inventory and warehouse operations

Reduce operational and transportation costs

Maximize profit margins and customer satisfaction

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description
The dataset contains warehouse, inventory, supplier, sales, and logistics information. Key columns include:

Warehouse_ID, Location, Current_Stock, Demand_Forecast, Lead_Time_Days

Stockout_Risk, Order_Processing_Time, Monthly_Sales, Supplier_ID

Return_Rate, Operational_Cost, Transportation_Cost, Damaged_Goods

Customer_Rating, Warehouse_Capacity, Employee_Count

üîç Key Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
Handled missing values

Normalized inconsistent units and formats

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation heatmap to understand feature impact

Analysis of delay factors and backorder trends

Demand vs Stock comparison by location

3. SQL-Based Analysis
Querying warehouse performance

Identifying high-risk suppliers (high return rate, low rating)

Grouping data by region/product category for trend analysis

4. Power BI Dashboard
Created interactive visuals:

Stock vs Demand by Warehouse

Delay Contributors (Processing, Shipping, Lead Time)

Cost Breakdown (Operational vs Transportation)

Forecast Accuracy vs Actual Sales

Slicers for filtering by:

Region, Product Category, Warehouse ID

üìà Insights & Results
Recommended reallocation of stock from low-demand to high-risk zones

Reduced delivery delays by 20% in simulations through supplier optimization

Visualized cost inefficiencies and improvement opportunities
